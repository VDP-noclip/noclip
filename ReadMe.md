# Noclip
NOCLIP is an experimental first-person game in which you break its boundaries to discover a secret reality. You can find and download the game on [itch](https://polimi-game-collective.itch.io/noclip).

You've found yourself on a mysterious planet. You're able to feel it: your surroundings do not feel quite right. You are not real. Yet, discovering that you belong to a digital world gave you the power to transcend reality and see what lies beyond the simulation, letting you spot invisible and intangible objects hidden around the map.

You'll have to solve platforming puzzles by noclipping through the map, memorizing the path to your goal. However, your real body isn't as free: you'll need to be quick and accurate with your movements! During platforming you'll only have a limited time, which can be recharged through various checkpoints.

Will you be ready?
