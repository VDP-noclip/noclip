# noclip prototype demo level

## Level editing

Edit the level with probuilder, all blocks that are affected by noclip mode should be tagged with "noclipObject" and then either their meshcollider or meshrenderer should be disabled before running the game. 

## Movement controls

-Toggle noclip mode with T  
-WASD to move  
-Space to jump/move up  
-LSHIFT to move down  
-ALT+F4 close the game  
(noclip movement system likely to be changed)

### Known bugs
-~~Blocks that are non collidable in clip mode become collidable in noclip mode~~  
-~~Holding space while going back to clip mode will teleport you to noclip location~~
